This repo is dedicate to the Quorum Tech Test solution.

The instructions regarding the files in this repo are bellow.

# How to run the code
All the source code is inside the Code folder. In order to run it in debug mode, you should clone the repo, open the .sln file (with VS or VSCode, preferably) and execute it.  

If you want to simply run the final .exe file, go to *Code/bin/Release/net8.0* and run the **QuorumTest.exe** file. Using this file, you'll be able to generate the CSV files and see the console output.  

# Output files
The requested output files are located at *Code/bin/Release/net8.0/CSV files*. If you want to test the generation of these files, you can delete them and run the .exe file.

# Test Questions 
The questions asked at the test guide are responded in the **Questions response.docx** file
